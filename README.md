# Pinger

## Description

Think about when github or jira is down and you just want to ping them once in a while to see if they're back up. Wouldn't it be nice to have an app that will give you a desktop notification when it does get a response?

## Why

I just wanted to try out Tauri so I made this app that pings websites.

## Features

- List of websites persisted to disk
- Basic timeout to control how long you want to ping a website
- Desktop notifications when a website responds 

## Still Missing

- Doesn't judge _quality_ of response
